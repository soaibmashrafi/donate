            The floods in Bangladesh are thought to be the most severe in 100 years. More than a third of the
            country
            has
            been submerged. At least 115 people have died and more than 5.7 million are affected. The government and
            NGOs
            are struggling to cope with the extent of the disaster and warn of risk of disease as well as shortages
            of
            crucial supplies including food, medication and clean drinking water. More than half a million homes
            have
            been
            damaged.
